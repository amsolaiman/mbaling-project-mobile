<h1 align="center">mBALING Project Mobile App</h1>

The mBALING project is a student housing management system for on-campus housing establishments in the Mindanao State University campus. It is intended to assist the university Housing Management Division in the record-keeping of non-dormitory-residing students' residential data, and to bring the current housing marketing and searching methods in the campus online. It consists of a mobile application that manages the activities and displays the contents posted by users, and a desktop admin system that administers user records and the creation and deletion of user accounts.

## Overview

The mBALING app serves as the mobile counterpart of the project, where all user activities take place. Test the app demo with:

> Use **demo_landlord** with password **@demo123** for landlord users (mobile app).

> Use **demo_student** with password **@demo123** for student users (mobile app).
